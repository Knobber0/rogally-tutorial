# What is the cause of the poor performance?

While the hardware is not the best, it shatters the numbers compared to its previous generation competitor steamdeck, while steamdeck runs a Zen2 Cpu and RDNA2 Gpu the Rog Ally runs a Zen3 cpu and RDNA3 Gpu. While this is not a only reason it outperforms the steamdeck it plays a big factor. Besides a obvious hardware limit the software here is quite big of a problem. To be clear windows 11 is not the exact cause of the poor-er performance but the lack of integration with the Rog Ally results in a bloated feel and buggy experience. Some users and youtubers mention the Rog Ally just not going into hibernation because of windows.

# What is the alternative?

The Solution to this issue is most logically Linux, while linux is not perfect and has trouble with kernel level anticheats ignoring the obviously better experience would be foolish to say the least. Thats why this guide will be focusing to use linux and thats why you need some sort of linux knowledge to proceed.

# So what can i do about it?

To find out what can **YOU** do about youre poor experience and poor performance, proceed with reading the documentation.
