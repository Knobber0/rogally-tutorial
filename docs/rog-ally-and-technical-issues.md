# Understanding the ASUS ROG Ally

This page explains the ROG Ally’s hardware and why its performance often feels worse than expected.

## The hardware is not the limiting factor

> [!NOTE]
> The ROG Ally X specifications are not covered here.  
> Aside from color and an increased battery capacity (40Wh → 80Wh), the hardware is identical.

While the hardware is not the best available, it significantly outperforms the Steam Deck in numbers. The Steam Deck uses a Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 GPU, whereas the ROG Ally uses a newer CPU and GPU architecture.

## Why does performance still feel poor?


While this alone is not the only reason the ROG Ally outperforms the Steam Deck, it plays a major role. Aside from obvious hardware limits, software is a major factor. Windows 11 itself is not the sole cause of poorer performance, but the lack of proper integration with the ROG Ally results in a bloated and sometimes buggy experience. Several users and YouTubers have reported issues such as the device failing to properly enter hibernation or sleep states when running Windows.

## What is the alternative?

The most logical solution is Linux. While Linux is not perfect and has known issues with kernel-level anti-cheat systems, ignoring the overall improvement in experience would be unrealistic.

For this reason, this guide focuses on using Linux, and this is why basic Linux knowledge is required before continuing.
