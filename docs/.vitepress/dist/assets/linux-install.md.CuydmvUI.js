For example i have not choosen bazzite because it is filled to the brim with flatpaks, and flatpaks while some may consider &quot;good&quot; are generally pretty bad because of permission issues and uneccesery sandbox resulting in poor-er performance. While on the other hand CachyOS is pretty decent it just has tons of stuff that are not really neccesery for the Rog Ally.</p><h2 id="how-to-actually-install-archlinux" tabindex="-1">How to actually install Archlinux? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-actually-install-archlinux" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to actually install Archlinux?&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Make sure to boot into bios before and disable secure boot to avoid issues when install archlinux.
