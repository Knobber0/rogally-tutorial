Aside from obvious hardware limits, software is a major factor. Windows 11 itself is not the sole cause of poorer performance, but the lack of proper integration with the ROG Ally results in a bloated and sometimes buggy experience. Quite a few users and YouTubers have reported issues such as the device failing to properly enter hibernation or sleep states when running Windows.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-alternative" tabindex="-1">What is the alternative? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-alternative" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the alternative?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The most logical solution is Linux.
