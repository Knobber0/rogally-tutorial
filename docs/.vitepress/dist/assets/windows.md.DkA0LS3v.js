While this is not a only reason it outperforms the steamdeck it plays a big factor. Besides a obvious hardware limit the software here is quite big of a problem. To be clear windows 11 is not the exact cause of the poor-er performance but the lack of integration with the Rog Ally results in a bloated feel and buggy experience. Some users and youtubers mention the Rog Ally just not going into hibernation because of windows.</p><h1 id="what-is-the-alternative" tabindex="-1">What is the alternative? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-alternative" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the alternative?&quot;">​</a></h1><p>The Solution to this issue is most logically Linux, while linux is not perfect and has trouble with kernel level anticheats ignoring the obviously better experience would be foolish to say the least.
